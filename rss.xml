            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Looks like people want encryption.</h1><p>Interview Secure email service ProtonMail has come out of beta and re-opened free registration to all for the first time in almost two years. Applications to join the invite-only service had been backed up almost since the day it launched, as the free encrypted mail service quickly reached its upper capacity of users and struggled to grow to meet demand.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/328dd532a09336e3241a34f19346a5342387b779.jpg"></article>]]></description>
