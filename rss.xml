            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The FBI Warns That Car Hacking Is a Real Risk</h1><p>It's been eight months since a pair of security researchers proved beyond any doubt that car hacking is more than an action movie plot device when they remotely killed the transmission of a 2014 Jeep Cherokee as I drove it down a St. Louis highway.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_0724-1200x630.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Key logging </h1><p>A new email-based attack campaign is targeting key employees from companies in the U.S., Middle East and Asia with the goal of compromising their computers and email accounts. This type of attack is known as business email compromise (BEC) and involves attackers hijacking the email accounts of business executives or accounting employees who typically authorize financial transactions inside organizations.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/26688a4d1527afa4a0d3e16de9390a6de39c6f69.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hear that Appel fans.</h1><p>We've discovered a new family of iOS malware that successfully infected non-jailbroken devices we've named "AceDeceiver". What makes AceDeceiver different from previous iOS malware is that instead of abusing enterprise certificates as some iOS malware has over the past two years, AceDeceiver manages to install itself without any enterprise certificate at all.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9087bd3d6cb0e776238c256f436116a50bd5f072.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Looks like people want encryption.</h1><p>Interview Secure email service ProtonMail has come out of beta and re-opened free registration to all for the first time in almost two years. Applications to join the invite-only service had been backed up almost since the day it launched, as the free encrypted mail service quickly reached its upper capacity of users and struggled to grow to meet demand.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/328dd532a09336e3241a34f19346a5342387b779.jpg"></article>]]></description>
